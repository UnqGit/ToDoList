# TO DO LIST
It is a very flexible console to do list, you can add, delete, edit, set priority, mark complete/incomplete.
> It uses a txt file, not a *json* file as i haven't learned that yet but it uses a custom delimiter for proper parsing.

## HOW TO RUN
If using an online IDE(for eg, onlineGDB, replit) to test it, make 4 files, named main.cpp todo.h todo.cpp tasks.txt and run it after pasting the contents.
If using a compiler, enter:

`g++ -o output main.cpp todo.cpp`
and run it using:

`./output`

### LICENSE
use it however you'd like idc but if anything goes rogue, `don't put the blame on me, i am only human after all` :D

### FUTURE PLAN
Add json file for more modularity
